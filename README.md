## About The Project

[![Amelia Start Page][product-screenshot]](https://hugohabel.github.io/amelia-start-page/)

There are many great start pages available on the Chrome Web Store, however, I didn't find one that really fits my needs. So, as every piece of software, I created a new one to match what I'm looking for. I want to create a start page so amazing that it'll be your companion every single day -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* We spend valuable time searching for really simple things in Google (timezones üïê, weather ‚õÖ, news üì∞, etc). This is handy information that should be available just by opening a new tab.
* You shouldn't be searching the same things over and over, like getting the timezones differences before setting up a meeting üïê
* I don't know you, but in my case, my browser is definitely one of the 3 apps that I use the most during my day.

Of course, no one start page will serve everyone since your needs may be different. So I decided to create widgets for every functionality, and I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest new widgets and/or functionality by opening an issue.

### Why is this app named Amelia?

This app is named after [Amelia Earhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart) who was an aviation poineer. She was the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
